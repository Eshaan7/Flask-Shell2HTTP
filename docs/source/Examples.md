## Examples

We have created some example python scripts to demonstrate various use-cases. These include extension setup as well as making HTTP calls with python's [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) module.

- [run_script.py](https://github.com/Eshaan7/Flask-Shell2HTTP/blob/master/examples/run_script.py): Execute a script on a succesful POST request to an endpoint.
- [basic.py](https://github.com/Eshaan7/Flask-Shell2HTTP/blob/master/examples/basic.py): Map a base command to an endpoint and pass dynamic arguments to it.
- [multiple_files.py](https://github.com/Eshaan7/Flask-Shell2HTTP/blob/master/examples/multiple_files.py): Upload multiple files for a single command.
